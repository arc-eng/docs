# Domain Model

This document outlines the domain model of Arcane Engine, providing insights into the purpose and relationships of the models within the system.

## Models
- **GitHubAccount**: Represents a GitHub user account. Defined in `webhooks/models.py`.
- **GitHubAppInstallation**: Represents an installation of the Arcane Engine GitHub app on a user account. Defined in `webhooks/models.py`.
- **Task**: Represents a task that Arcane Engine performs, such as processing a command from a GitHub comment. Defined in `engine/models.py`.
- **TaskEvent**: Represents an event that occurs during the execution of a Task. Defined in `engine/models.py`.
- **TaskBill**: Represents the billing information for a Task. Defined in `engine/models.py`.
- **CostItem**: Represents a cost item associated with a Task. Defined in `engine/models.py`.
- **PilotUser**: Represents a user of the Arcane Engine system. Defined in `accounts/models.py`.
- **UserBudget**: Represents the budget allocated to a PilotUser for using Arcane Engine. Defined in `accounts/models.py`.

## Overview
The domain model of Arcane Engine revolves around the concept of Tasks. A Task is created whenever a user interacts with Arcane Engine by issuing a command through a GitHub comment. Each Task can generate multiple TaskEvents, which track the progress and actions taken during the Task's execution. TaskBills and CostItems are used to manage the billing and cost associated with executing a Task. The GitHubAccount and GitHubAppInstallation models facilitate the interaction between Arcane Engine and GitHub, while the PilotUser and UserBudget models manage the users of the Arcane Engine system and their allocated budgets.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    GitHubAccount "1" -- "1" GitHubAppInstallation : has
    Task "1" -- "*" TaskEvent : generates
    Task "1" -- "1" TaskBill : billed through
    Task "*" -- "*" CostItem : includes
    PilotUser "1" -- "*" UserBudget : allocates
```

## TaskEngine, Task, and TaskScheduler

This section visualizes the relationship between `TaskEngine`, `Task`, and `TaskScheduler` within the Arcane Engine project. `TaskEngine` is responsible for executing tasks, while `TaskScheduler` is responsible for scheduling them. `Task` acts as the central entity that is executed by the `TaskEngine` and scheduled by the `TaskScheduler`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TaskEngine {
        +Task task
        +int max_steps
        +create_unique_branch_name(basis: str): str
        +setup_working_branch(branch_name_basis: str): str
        +finalize_working_branch(branch_name: str): bool
        +generate_task_title(): void
        +run(): str
        +create_bill(): void
        +clone_github_repo(): void
    }
    class Task {

        -String response_comment_url
        -String result
        -String pilot_command
        +schedule(): void
    }
    class TaskScheduler {
        +Task task
        +schedule(): void
    }
    TaskEngine --|> Task : executes
    TaskScheduler --|> Task : schedules
```
