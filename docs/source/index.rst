Arcane Engine Documentation
===========================

Save time and stay in the flow by delegating routine work to the Arcane Engine.

Tasks
-----

**Everything** in Arcane Engine is a task. A task is a unit of work that can be automated by the engine.
All tasks are described in natural language and can be as simple or complex as you need them to be.

Quick Start
-----------

First, `add Arcane Engine to your GitHub repository <https://github.com/apps/arcane-engine/installations/new>`_.

Now you're ready to create your first task. There are many ways to do this:

- Using the `CLI <https://github.com/arc-eng/cli>`_ - Create tasks right from your terminal
- `Arcane Studio <https://arcane.engineer/studio/>`_ - Our open-source web interface
- With our `Development Kit <https://arcane.engineer/kit>`_ - Integrate Arcane Engine into your own tools

To learn more about the engine and how it works, head over to our `User Guide <user_guide.html>`_ or get inspiration
from our `Demo Repository <https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/demo>`_.
