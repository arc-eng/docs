## What Arcane Engine Struggles With
There are a few things that **Arcane Engine** still struggles with. We're working hard on improving these capabilities:

### Editing Large Files
Arcane Engine can read and write to files, but it struggles with large files.
GPT-4 has the baked-in tendency to leave placeholders like `# Rest of the file remains unchanged` when it encounters large files.

**Workaround**: Break down large files into smaller ones and use Arcane Engine to edit them.

### Complex Scenarios
The more complex the scenario, the more likely Arcane Engine is going to get sloppy, leave things out or misunderstand your command.

**Workaround**: Break down complex scenarios into smaller, more manageable tasks and combine them in a back-and-forth conversation.
